As we all know, digital currency is based on blockchain technology and platform, and it is also the most typical application of blockchain, and it is not the only one.

Taking Bitcoin as an example, its platform provides the function of transferring funds between users, but it does not provide the functions of transaction and payment. As a result, Bitcoin cannot communicate with the outside world, let alone be truly circulated, and cannot become a real currency.

Digital currency exchange system development can be divided into the following three types from the transaction process:

1. Centralized exchange: Add or delete user asset fields in the exchange's own database.

2. Decentralized exchange: Exchange directly on the blockchain, and the cryptocurrency will be sent directly back to the user's wallet or a smart contract stored on the blockchain.

3. Semi-decentralized exchange: Cryptocurrencies are sent to the designated wallet of the exchange for matching transactions, and the actual controller of the wallet used for the transaction belongs to the exchange.
